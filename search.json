    "text": "Project Abstract\nThe study aims to survey emerging adults (ages 18-34) to explore vaccine hesitancy for influenza and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as general healthcare utilization and behaviors. The sample population will primarily come from the Eugene-metro area and surrounding Lane County, Oregon, with additional participants from the Portland-metro area. Current literature and data have shown that the study population has low rates of healthcare utilization and vaccination, yet they exhibit heightened health needs often due to lifestyle factors (Tran & Silvestri-Elmore, 2021; Oregon Immunization Program, 2023). Using the Qualtrics platform, the survey will be distributed with the support of local partners. The project will assess the reasons behind vaccine hesitancy, identify accessibility barriers, and explore resources that may increase vaccine acceptance and general healthcare utilization. Additionally, the survey serves as a health promotion tool by incorporating educational questions. The findings aim to inform the development of targeted resources and interventions to promote vaccination and address public health gaps. While the results are most directly applicable to Lane County, the study offers implications for the broader teen and emerging adult population, provides recommendations for future research, and offers a model for conducting moderate-scale, community-based research.\nThe survey was distributed for an 8-week period (5/15/2025-7/14/25) and received a total of 91 complete responses, eligible for data analysis. Exclusion criteria included checking ‘I do not agree to take part in the study’ or incomplete surveys, as they were considered revoked consent."

The most common zip code of residence reported was 97401, which encapsulates the Eugene-metro area. In the Eugene, Oregon area. The most prominent school systems include University of Oregon, Bushnell University, and Lane Community College. The project was done in partnership with University of Oregon’s School of Planning, Public Policy, and Management through which there was a distribution emphasis around campus. Thus, It is likely that many of the respondents were affiliated with the University of Oregon."

    "section": "Preliminary Observations",
    "text": "Preliminary Observations\nOverall, it could be inferred that the emerging adult population is generally accepting of both Flu and COVID vaccinations. In comparison, there appears to be a higher acceptance of Flu vaccinations than COVID vaccinations. There are a variety of contributing factors that may influence this. In particular, the survey also looks at barriers so it is very possible that an respondent could have reported ‘somewhat disagree’ to receiving a particular vaccination due to the barriers they consistently face to accessing one, rather than as an indication of vaccine hesitancy. On a preliminary level, it is promising to see at least 50-60% levels of acceptance across the vaccination types as it indicates that emerging adults are making consistent proactive efforts to protect their health, as well as those around them."
